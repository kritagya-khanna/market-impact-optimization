## Analysis Pipeline

The Jupyter notebook (`market-impact-analysis.ipynb`) provides a complete end-to-end analysis:

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Order book data ingestion and cleaning
2. **Market Impact Calculation**: Multi-level VWAP impact analysis across order sizes
3. **Model Fitting**: Automated fitting of Linear, Square Root, and Power Law models
4. **Model Selection**: Performance comparison using R², RMSE, and AIC metrics
5. **Strategy Comparison**: Benchmarking optimal vs traditional strategies
6. **Visualization**: Comprehensive charts and performance analytics

## Market Impact Models

The system implements three market impact models with automatic selection based on fit quality:

### 1. Linear Model ✅ **Best for**: Simple proportional relationships
- **Formula**: `impact = β × order_size`
- **Parameters**: β (slope coefficient)
- **Characteristics**: Always convex, easy to optimize

### 2. Square Root Model ✅ **Best for**: Diminishing returns scenarios
- **Formula**: `impact = α × √(order_size)`
- **Parameters**: α (scale coefficient)  
- **Characteristics**: Natural concavity, well-suited for liquidity modeling

### 3. Power Law Model 🏆 **Winner in our analysis**
- **Formula**: `impact = α × order_size^β`
- **Parameters**: α (scale), β (exponent)
- **Characteristics**: Most flexible, handles various market regimes
- **Results**: Achieved R² > 0.99 across all tested stocks
- **Convexity Handling**: Automatic linearization for β < 1 to maintain optimization compatibility

## Performance Results

Our analysis of real market data shows:

| Stock | Best Model | R² Score | RMSE | Optimal vs TWAP Savings |
|-------|------------|----------|------|-------------------------|
| CRWV  | Power Law  | 0.9977   | 2.1e-6 | **99.77%** |
| FROG  | Power Law  | 0.9978   | 2.2e-6 | **99.78%** |
| SOUN  | Power Law  | 0.9984   | 1.8e-6 | **99.84%** |

## Usage

### Quick Start: Run Optimization

```python
from src.models.impact_models import create_model
from src.optimization.constraints import create_basic_constraints
from src.optimization import MarketImpactOptimizer

# Create a Power Law model with fitted parameters
model = create_model('Power Law', {
    'alpha': 0.000610,
    'beta': 0.2265
})

# Define execution constraints
constraints = create_basic_constraints(
    total_shares=5000,      # Total position to execute
    time_periods=50,        # Execution window (e.g., minutes)
    max_order_size=500      # Maximum single order size
)

# Optimize execution schedule
optimizer = MarketImpactOptimizer(model, 'STOCK_SYMBOL')
result = optimizer.optimize(constraints)

if result.success:
    print(f"Total cost: {result.total_cost:.6f}")
    print(f"Execution schedule: {result.execution_schedule}")
    print(f"Solver used: {result.solver_status}")
```

### Load Pre-fitted Parameters

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

# Load fitted parameters from analysis
with open('data/parameters/fitted_parameters.json', 'r') as f:
    fitted_params = json.load(f)

# Get parameters for a specific stock
stock_params = fitted_params['CRWV']
model = create_model(stock_params['model_type'], stock_params['parameters'])

print(f"Model: {stock_params['model_type']}")
print(f"R²: {stock_params['performance']['r2']:.4f}")
```

### Strategy Comparison

```python
from src.strategies.benchmark_strategies import TWAPStrategy, FrontLoadedStrategy

# Initialize strategies
twap = TWAPStrategy()
frontload = FrontLoadedStrategy()

# Generate schedules
twap_schedule = twap.generate_schedule(total_shares=5000, time_periods=50)
front_schedule = frontload.generate_schedule(total_shares=5000, time_periods=50)

# Compare costs
twap_cost = sum(model.calculate_impact(size) * size for size in twap_schedule)
front_cost = sum(model.calculate_impact(size) * size for size in front_schedule)

print(f"TWAP cost: {twap_cost:.6f}")
print(f"Front-loaded cost: {front_cost:.6f}")
print(f"Difference: {((front_cost - twap_cost) / twap_cost * 100):.2f}%")
```

## Key Components

### MarketImpactOptimizer
Core optimization engine that converts market impact models into convex optimization problems.
- **Multi-solver support**: Automatically tries OSQP, SCS, CLARABEL
- **Robust error handling**: Graceful fallback between solvers
- **Performance tracking**: Detailed optimization metadata and timing

### OptimizationResult
Comprehensive container for optimization results:
```python
result.success          # Boolean: optimization succeeded
result.execution_schedule  # numpy.ndarray: optimal order sizes
result.total_cost       # float: total execution cost
result.solver_status    # str: solver used and status
result.solve_time       # float: optimization time in seconds
```

### ConstraintConfig
Flexible constraint system supporting:
- **Order size limits**: Min/max order sizes with validation
- **Participation rate constraints**: Market impact limitations
- **Risk management**: Concentration and exposure limits
- **Timing constraints**: Deadline and pacing requirements

### ObjectiveBuilder
Automatically converts market impact models to CVXPY-compatible objectives:
- **Convexity detection**: Ensures optimization compatibility
- **Model-specific handling**: Optimized formulations for each model type
- **Linear approximation**: For non-convex cases (Power Law with β < 1)

### Benchmark Strategies
Built-in strategy implementations for comparison:
- **TWAP**: Time-Weighted Average Price (equal distribution)
- **VWAP**: Volume-Weighted Average Price
- **Front-loaded**: Aggressive early execution
- **Back-loaded**: Conservative delayed execution

## Solver Support & Performance

The system uses CVXPY with multiple solver backends for reliability:

| Solver | Primary Use | Performance | Availability |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **OSQP** | Quadratic problems | Fast, reliable | ✅ Included |
| **SCS** | Large-scale problems | Robust, scalable | ✅ Included |
| **CLARABEL** | General convex | High precision | ✅ Included |

**Automatic Solver Selection**: The optimizer tries multiple solvers and selects the first successful one, ensuring robust execution across different problem types and scales.

## Data & Model Performance

### Dataset
- **Source**: High-frequency order book data (Level 2 market data)
- **Stocks**: CRWV, FROG, SOUN (representative small to mid-cap stocks)
- **Timeframe**: Multiple trading days per stock
- **Granularity**: Tick-by-tick order book snapshots

### Model Selection Results
All three stocks showed consistent preference for Power Law models:

```
Power Law Model: impact = α × order_size^β

CRWV: α=0.000610, β=0.227, R²=0.9977
FROG: α=0.000617, β=0.225, R²=0.9978  
SOUN: α=0.000289, β=0.244, R²=0.9984
```

**Key Insight**: The β exponent consistently < 1 indicates diminishing marginal impact, suggesting market resilience to larger orders when properly executed.
